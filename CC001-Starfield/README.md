# Coding Challenge #01: Starfield

This is a MacOS X - Swift 4 - SpriteKit implementation of the Starfield Coding Challenge (#01) created by [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/).

In this version was extra added:

- When the mouse is in the top half of the screen, the star circles are drawn, otherwise they are hidden.
