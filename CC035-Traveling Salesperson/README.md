# Coding Challenge #35: Traveling Salesperson

This is a MacOS X - Swift 4 - SpriteKit implementation of the Traveling Salesperson Coding Challenge (#35) created by [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/).

In this version was extra added:

- Add locations by clicking somewhere in the scene.
- Reset the locations by hitting the spacebar.
- The starting point is always the first added point. (A salesperson has a starting location doesn't he?)

TODO:

- Genetic algorithm
