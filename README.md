# Coding Challenges

This repository is a collection of the all the Coding Train Coding Callenges I have replicated. These challenges are a way to keep programming. And because I love the Swift programming language, I decided to use Xcode, SpriteKit & SceneKit to implement my version.

I would like to thank Dan Shiffman for all the great video's, books and websites he has created. His enthousiastic video's are the reason I started this repository.

My goal is to catch up with the challenges. To have a broad overview of my progress, [check this file](Checklist%20Challenges.md)

The original videos for these challenges are on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH)
